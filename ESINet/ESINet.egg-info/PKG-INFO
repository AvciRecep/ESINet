Description: Solve the M/EEG inverse problem using artificial neural networks with Python 3
        and the MNE library.
        
        The functions allow you to 
        * Create a forward model that solves the M/EEG forward problem
        * Simulate brain sources and corresponding EEG activity
        * Load and train a neural network to solve the inverse problem
        * Inspect the performance of the neural network*
