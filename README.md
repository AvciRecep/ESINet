Solve the M/EEG inverse problem using artificial neural networks with Python 3
and the MNE library.

The functions allow you to 
* Create a forward model that solves the M/EEG forward problem
* Simulate brain sources and corresponding EEG activity
* Load and train a neural network to solve the inverse problem
* Inspect the performance of the neural network*
